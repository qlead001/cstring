## About

This library was created for use in a simple compiler. It is mostly
a wrapper around the standard [string.h] with some extra safety. It
adds a length and capacity to its string structure.

### Safety

Safety is not now, nor will ever be, guaranteed. For most use cases this
library is probably perfectly safe, but I make no promises.
